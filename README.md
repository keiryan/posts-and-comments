### Setup

To get started clone the repo:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/haystackdev/hstk-int-react-take-home-1.git
```

Install node modules:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

Then you can run the app with:

```
npm run start
```

Or

```
yarn start
```

## Take Home Test Structure

This site is already setup with a few things. The first screen you see should look something like this:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mSs2ykQ/Take-Home-Test-Screenshot.png" alt="Take-Home-Test-Screenshot" border="0" />

The buttons on this screen will navigate to three separate screens, each corresponding to a section of the test. The screens will be blank initially, it is your job to build the screens in order to meet the requirements of each section of the test. Please make sure that all of your work renders into the components exported by each of these three screen files `PartOne.js`, `PartTwo.js` and `PartThree.js`. You may create new files if you want. Please do not modify `MainScreen.js`, but you can modify any other files as necessary.

# The Test

In this test you'll be working with placeholder data from a backend found here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

You will be scored based on completion of the tasks below. Scores are for us to communicate to you how heavily we weight each task and help you decide whether or not you want to attempt to complete each task, in case you get stuck and need to skip to the next task.

If you fail to complete all tasks that doesn't necessarily mean you wont be able to move forward in the interview process.

Please complete each task in the corresponding component file in "src/screens". You can create as many files as you'd like and put them anywhere you'd like, just make sure the question is answered in the screen file itself and can still be navigated too from `MainScreen.js`.

You may download and use any third party libraries that you want. No points are given for styling other than styling that is explicitly included in one of the questions, so feel free to not style anything at all.

We value simple, straight forward solutions more than anything else.

**_For data fetching use hstkFetch exported from `src/hstkFetch.js` instead of the typical `fetch` or any other solution. hstkFetch works exactly like javascript's built in fetch except that it simulates a one second reponse delay._**

You are not expected to handle errors for any requests that fail for some reason other than what happened in your code. Feel free to make any fetch requests inside of a `useEffect` callback for this challenge (although generally speaking you may not want to do that).

## Part One

Put all your work in `PartOne.js`

### Display a List (10 points)

We're going to be working with "posts" data which are a json object containing a title and body. You can think of them as a facebook post, or something like that.

A single post looks like this:

```js
{
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "title": "qui est esse",
    "body": "est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
}
```

There is an array of posts contained in the file `src/localPlaceholderData.js`.

Render a this data in a list that shows the "title" and "id" of each post in order, importing the data from `src/localPlaceholderData.js`.

Display the text in a column (id should be below title visually).

### Make it prettier (20 points)

Add 12 padding to each row.

Add an icon to each row to the left of the text (text should still be in a vertical column). You can use any icon you want.

The max width of the text should not exceed 50% of the row width.

Add a chevron on the far right side of the row, keeping the rest of the content left aligned. This icon should not show on "phone sized" screens.

**(Hint)**
The layout should be similar to that of the rows on the main screen of the app. The big difference is that we now have some vertically stacked text.

## Part Two

At this point, _copy and paste all of your code from PartOne.js into PartTwo.js_. Do not modify `PartOne.js` after this. Work on `PartTwo.js` for part two.

### Fetching Data (20 points)

Now we would like to fetch data from our backend to show to our users instead of using the data from `src/localPlaceholderData.js`

Fetch the posts from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` to show the user. You should not be showing data from `src/localPlaceholderData.js` after this task. Remember to use the `hstkFetch` function to fetch any data.

### Loading Indicator (30 points)

Give the user some type of loading indicator while the data is being fetched. No pressure to do anything fancy here, a simple message on the screen that just says `Loading...` will suffice. But if you want to do a fancy or animation or something go for it.

### Search By Title (50 points)

Add a text input to the screen that allows users to search for posts by their title. It should behave as follows:

- Any time the user types text into the text input the app filters out posts that don't include the search text in the body. Do so _locally_. Don't refetch any data, just change which posts are displayed.
- This should be case insensitive for both the input and the text of the post. (Doesn't matter if input text is has uppercase letter, doesn't matter if post body has uppercase letter, behavior should be the same).
- If the text input's value is the empty string all posts are shown.
- The text input should not render if the data hasn't yet loaded.
- Display a message that says `No Results` when there are no posts containing the search text.

## Part Three

Please copy and paste all code from `PartTwo.js` into `PartThree.js` before beginning this section.

### Navigate to PartThreeDetail.js (50 points)

Make it so each row in the list is now clickable, and when the user clicks on the row the app navigates to the component in `PartThreeDetail.js`, passing the `id` of the post as a navigation parameter, _do not pass anything other than the post id as a navigation parameter_.

### Post Details (50 points)

In `PartThreeDetail.js`, fetch the post data using the `id` that's been passed as a navigation parameter. Do not fetch all of the posts again, only fetch the post with the given id. Documentation is somewhere on `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`. Remember to use the `hstkFetch` function for fetching.

Show the `title` and the `body` of the post on this screen after fetching.

### Post Comments (50 points)

Fetch all comments for the given post `id` and display them in a list. Check the documentation on json placeholder to see how.

Show the `email` and `body` text in each item in the list.

Do not fetch any comments that do not have the post id that was passed as a navigation parameter.

### Hide Comment Button (30 points)

Add a button to each comment row that permanently hides the comment. Do this locally (don't communicate with jsonplaceholder)

### BONUS CHALLENGE - Persist hidden comments (30 points)

Persist hidden comments (IE if you hide a comment it should stay hidden even if your user closes the browser window). Do this locally.

If you made it this far, congratulations! This concludes the test. When you're finished, create a repository with your code and email a link to dylanz@hstk.com, and CC joshh@hstk.com and juliah@hstk.com. Or if you wish, you can zip the project, upload to google drive and share it that way. Just remember to email it to us three. Thanks!
